//! Database module to handle player registration, login, and player statistics using SQLite.
//! 
//! This module provides functionality for player management, including:
//! - Registering new players with a unique ID and initial wallet balance.
//! - Logging in players by their username.
//! - Retrieving player statistics (games played, games won, wallet balance).
//! - Updating player statistics after a game.
//! 
//! It uses `sqlx` for asynchronous database interactions and `uuid` for unique player IDs.
